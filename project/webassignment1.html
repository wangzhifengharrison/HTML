    <h2>1.1&1.2 Introduce Yourself and/or Your Passion</h2>
    <div>

    <p>
    My name is Zhifeng Wang. IÂ´m a student of Australian National University. Australian National University provide virtual school that I have attended online at home. I've been starting playing tennis in high school and looking forward improve my tennis technology in this spring. Tennis has always been a big part of my life. My grandpa put a racquet in my hand when I learned how to walk and had me on the court when I was two. I've played many other sports than tennis. I've played football, soccer, Karate, baseball, basketball, fencing, and wrestling. Tennis, Karate, and baseball were my three main sports that I played until 8th grade.

    <p>
    Things I like to do off the court are hanging out with my friends, spending time with my family, playing with my dog Izzy, traveling, and meeting new people. One thing I love about tennis is the result of playing the game either if you win or lose because it shows you what you need to work on. I have appreciated the growth of what I have accomplished and very thankful for the coaching staff I have and very thankful for a supportive family.

    <h2>1.3 Create a CSS</h2>
    Create an external (separate) CSS file. Use at least 10 CSS rules. Make sure your CSS includes comments that would be useful to someone taking over the maintenance of your site, things like the purpose of each rule, exceptions to its use and the choice you made as to which selector you specified. If you create more than one CSS make sure they are deployed in a Cascading manner, i.e. there should be at least one default CSS that will be applied to all the pages in your site, with specialised CSS then being applied to specific pages of the web site.

    <!-- use table and list to create site map -->
    <h2>1.4 Build a Site Map</h2>
    <table type="1">

    <h2>1.5 Provide a Source Log</h2>

    <div>
      You will need to keep a log. A typical log describes the list of sources you used for your project and the modifications you applied to them. The origin of the source should be given in enough detail to ensure the marker can access the source whenever it is possible (URL, ISBN etc). Make sure you update the source log as you expand your web site in Parts 2 and 3.
    </div>

    <h2>1.6 Provide an opportunity for feedback</h2>

<div id="replyform">
<div id="replyform_a">
<p>Don't forget to give your visitors a chance to comment on your website. If you have put a lot of work into creating your images, you will want to know what other people think about them. A feedback form will allow them to do this.</p>
</div>

  <div id="replyform_b">

  <h4>Tell us what you think!</h4>
  <p>Please complete the form below to let me know what you think about my website. If you would like a response, please include your email address.</p>
  <form enctype="text/plain"
     action="mailto:sabrina.caldwell@anu.edu.au">

  <input type="text" name="site"

    <h2>1.7 Separate assignment page from pages</h2>

    <div>
      The top page of your website (passion pages) is the usual index.html. You will also include an assignment.html file that will be explained to you in the first lab. Use and modify the assessment.html assignment.html page which lists all the assignment requirements for this assignment, and make sure it provides direct links to your content. E.g. the source log or feedback page may not be relevant to your passion so you can avoid showing it to normal users coming in via the index.html page, but for marking purposes we need to find this content so it should be linked to from your assignment.html page. The choices you make can be briefly explained in your assignment.html page, but don't write too much there, as we are marking your web page for your passion and the assignment.html page is mainly to help us find all the components we want to mark. The MOOC materials and tasks have significant overlap with the Assignment Part 1. You will need to add some extra components to the MOOC tasks and that is your Assignment Part 1.
